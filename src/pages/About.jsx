      <h1>About Kindness Wall</h1>
      <p>
        Kindness Wall is a space where people can share uplifting messages and
        spread positivity. It was created to remind us that even small words of
        encouragement can brighten someone’s day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was built by a sensitive and creative student who believes
        kindness can change the world. The goal is to combine technology with
        empathy, showing that web apps can have a heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re posting a note of gratitude, sharing hope, or simply
        browsing, we hope you leave here feeling a little lighter.
